# MSc-AI-Robotics-Benchmarking-LLMs

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks for Language Models (LMs) using Hugging Face's Transformers library. The notebooks are designed to be straightforward to use.

## Setup

To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RuturajKotwal/MSc-AI-Robotics-Benchmarking-LLMs.git
   cd MSc-AI-Robotics-Benchmarking-LLMs
   ```

2. **Install the required libraries:**

   Ensure you have Python 3.6+ installed. Install the necessary dependencies using pip

3. **Download the COCO dataset:**

   The COCO dataset is required for training and can be easily downloaded using the `coco_downloader.ipynb` notebook provided in this repository. Navigate to the notebook and execute the cells to download and prepare the dataset.

Each notebook includes detailed instructions and code to guide you through the process of training and evaluating the language models.

## Dataset

We use the COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset for training the models. The dataset can be downloaded using the `coco_downloader.ipynb` notebook provided in this repository. The notebook handles downloading, preprocessing, and organizing the data for training.

## Usage

- Open and execute the notebooks in Jupyter environment.
- Follow the instructions provided within each notebook to execute specific tasks (training, evaluation, etc.).
- Modify the code and parameters as needed for your own experiments.

## Acknowledgments

- Thanks to Hugging Face for their Transformers library and pre-trained models.
- The COCO dataset is used under its respective license terms.
